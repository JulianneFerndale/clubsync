# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> Read [POLICY.md](POLICY.md) before implementing any feature that touches authentication, passwords, role access, announcements, event creation, AI outputs, notifications, or student data.

## Commands

```bash
# First-time setup
composer run setup
# Runs: composer install, .env generation, key:generate, migrate, npm install, npm run build

# Development (starts server + queue worker + Vite HMR concurrently)
composer run dev

# Run tests
composer run test
# Clears config cache, then runs Pest (tests use in-memory SQLite per phpunit.xml)

# Run a single test file
php artisan test tests/Feature/SomeTest.php

# Frontend build
npm run build

# Database
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed   # Full reset with seeders
php artisan db:seed --class=SeedAdmin
```

## Architecture

**Stack:** Laravel 13 / PHP 8.3 + Vue 3 + Inertia.js + Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite. Default DB is SQLite (dev), configurable to MySQL.

**Authentication:** Firebase REST API — no Laravel Auth guards. The flow is:
1. `AuthManager::loginWithFirebase()` calls Firebase identitytoolkit REST endpoint
2. Firebase UID is matched to a MySQL `users` record
3. `SessionManager::store()` saves `idToken`, `uid`, `role`, `user_id` to Laravel session
4. `firebase.token` middleware auto-refreshes expired tokens on each request

**Middleware stack (routes/web.php):**
- `firebase.token` — validates/refreshes Firebase JWT in session
- `guest.firebase` — blocks authenticated users from auth pages
- `role:{role}` — enforces RBAC; the alias `officer` covers president/treasurer/mmo roles

**Roles:** `admin`, `dsa`, `adviser`, `president`, `treasurer`, `mmo`, `member`

Controllers are grouped by role under `app/Http/Controllers/{Admin,DSA,Adviser,Officer,Member}/`.

**Services (`app/Services/`):**
- `AuthManager` — Firebase REST auth wrapper (login, register, password reset, token refresh)
- `FirebaseService` — Firebase Realtime Database reads/writes
- `SessionManager` — Laravel session storage for auth state
- `GeminiService` — Google Gemini API for AI-assisted announcement drafting

**Frontend:** Blade templates in `resources/views/` are layout shells only. Vue 3 components via Inertia handle interactive pages. The Inertia entry point is `resources/js/app.js`. Controllers pass data to Vue components as Inertia props — not as Blade variables.

**Queue:** `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`. The `ai_notification_queue` table handles async Gemini AI jobs. Run `php artisan queue:listen` during development (included in `composer run dev`).

**External services required (set in `.env`):**
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` — auth + Realtime DB
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — AI announcement drafting

## Key Conventions

- Route names follow the pattern `{role}.{resource}.{action}` (e.g., `officer.events.store`)
- Role-specific views live under `resources/views/{role}/`
- Migrations are in `database/migrations/`; seeders cover departments, admin user, and sample clubs
- Tests use an in-memory SQLite DB (configured in `phpunit.xml`) — no Firebase calls in tests; mock `AuthManager` and `FirebaseService`
